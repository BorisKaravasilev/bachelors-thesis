## Goal

* Procedurally generating tropical islands in a sea
* Animating the sea's water surface with a custom shader

## Abstract

Within this thesis a procedural terrain generator and a water surface shader was designed.
These components were used in the implementation of a generator of infinite worlds composed of islands in the sea. Traditional methods to world partitioning and object placement
were modified to best suite this purpose. Additionally, an approach for generating terrain
of islands with diverse shapes by pseudo-randomly generating points defining the terrainâ€™s
properties was devised. The implemented island generator running in real-time is capable
of challenging the existing similar tools for Unity.
